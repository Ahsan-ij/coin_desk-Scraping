Halvings refer to bitcoin\u2019s issuance system, which was programmed into Bitcoin\u2019s code by Satoshi Nakamoto. It essentially involves automatically halving the number of new BTC entering circulation every 210,000 blocks.\nIn February 2011, BTC\u2019s price reached parity with the U.S dollar for the first time. The milestone encouraged new investors into the market, and over the next four months, bitcoin\u2019s price in USD continued to rise \u2013 peaking at over $30.\nBy early 2013, the leading cryptocurrency had recovered from a prolonged bearish episode and rose above $1,000, albeit only briefly. But with the infamous Mt Gox hack, China announcing its first ban on crypto and other situations, it took a further four years for the BTC price to return to above $1,000 again. Once that level was passed, however, bitcoin\u2019s price continued to surge dramatically throughout 2017 until BTC peaked at its previous long-standing all-time high of $19,850.\nOver 2018, the entire crypto market plunged into what is now known as the \u201ccrypto winter\u201d \u2013 a yearlong bear market. It wasn\u2019t until December 2020, when bitcoin returned to test the previous all-time high, that it eventually surpassed that historical level and rose a further 239% over the next 119 days to a new all-time high of $64,799.",
        "Q/A": {
            "About Bitcoin": "Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency that uses peer-to-peer technology and a blockchain to record transactions. It was created by Satoshi Nakamoto and the first block was mined on January 3, 2009. Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a blockchain, which is a distributed ledger that can be accessed by anyone to verify transactions. Transactions are verified by miners, who are rewarded with a set amount of Bitcoin and transaction fees. The supply of Bitcoin is limited to 21 million coins and it is divisible to eight decimal places. A wallet is needed to use Bitcoin and it consists of a public key, which is used to send and receive payments, and a private key, which is used to control the wallet. Bitcoin can be used for a variety of purposes, including everyday transactions, as a store of value, or for investment.",
            "Bitcoin (BTC) Price": "Bitcoin\u2019s price is renowned for being highly volatile, but despite that, it has become the top performing asset of any class (including stocks, commodities and bonds) over the past decade \u2013 climbing a staggering 9,000,000% between 2010 and 2020.",
